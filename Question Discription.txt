Automated Parking System with full Database 

This automatic parking system is a great opportunity for users to get a high level of 
service. This makes it very easy to reserve a space for your vehicle. This automatic 
system is designed with high technology and high security. The system works to 
allocate suitable space according to the size of your vehicle. Unregistered 
customers can register an account by providing their username, ID number and 
other requirements.
One grant advantage is that these parking spaces do not require drivers or vehicle 
owners to be assigned and are managed by staff members. It also includes separate 
functions to ensure that the system runs without errors.
Registered customers have a unique ID. Customers can contact us if they have any 
problems. The administrator is responsible for managing the activities of the entire system.
